# Introduction

This was just a side project made using Asp.net MVC tech stack. I will improve the readme further to fill in the other sections.
You can basically have an admin dashboard view and a public view. The admin dashboard allows the admin to add or remove content from the public view.

1. Installation process
2. Software dependencies
3. Latest releases
